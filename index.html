	<h1>No raw livers</h1>
	<p>Are you a vegetarian haruspex looking to get into a less messy line of work that doesn't involve so much raw meat? Give tea leaf reading a try, and free yourself from the inconvenience of finding sacrificial animals and disposing of fresh entrails. Particularly for urban dwellers, a nice tea set is much more practical than a full-sized outdoor altar.</a></p>
