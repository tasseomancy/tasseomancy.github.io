<div class="blurb">
	<p>The goal of the Protelis language is to make it easier to build a resilient and well-behaved networked system out of an assortment of different potentially mobile devices. Protelis is designed for the paradigm of "aggregate programming", a way of thinking about and decomposing problem that can be solved with a network of distributed sensors and computers. Aggregate programming tries to produce reliable and robust collective behavior from uncoordinated local interactions between machines. That's hard to do, but Protelis helps!</p>
	<p>Protelis was designed specifically to support aggregate programming:
	<ul>
	<li>Protelis is a language, not just a library. Because it's a language, Protelis can handle some of tough parts of distributed systems implicitly, preventing some common mistakes and problems.</li>
	<li>Protelis is hosted in and integrated with Java. It is lightweight and can take advantage of the large and well-established ecosystem of Java infrastructure and libraries.</li>
	<li>Although Protelis is not Java, it's designed to look similar. Developers who already know Java can more easily learn Protelis.</li>
	<li>Protelis can ensure safe and resilient composition because it is built on <i>field calculus</i>. Field calculus is a theoretical model of aggregate programming much like lambda calculus is for functional programming.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<h1>No more raw livers</h1>
	<p>Are you a vegetarian haruspex looking to get into a less messy line of work that doesn't involve so much raw meat? Give tea leaf reading a try, and free yourself from the inconvenience of finding sacrificial animals and disposing of fresh entrails. Particularly for urban dwellers, a nice tea set is much more practical than a full-sized outdoor altar.</a></p>
