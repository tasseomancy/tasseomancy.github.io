Protelis is a programming language designed for people who want to get resilient 
collective behavior from a complex network of heterogeneous machines. Protelis supports 
"aggregate programming" for applications like the Internet of Things or flocking robots. 
It lets you think about what you want to the collection of machines to accomplish, rather than 
what you need each individual machine to do.
